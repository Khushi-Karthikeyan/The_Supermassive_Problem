All data and code needed to generate the plots are available in `The_Supermassive_Problem.zip`. To generate the plots, download the zip, extract it into a folder, and open `code_release_and_plots.ipynb`. Update the first cell with the correct path information, then run the file.

`functions.py` contains publicly-available code developed by Rich Townsend, available [here](http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/resource/tools/mesa-web/mesa_web.py) under the name `mesa_web.py`. All other code was developed by Khushi Karthikeyan, with the assistance of AI models Microsoft Copilot, Github Copilot, and ChatGPT.
